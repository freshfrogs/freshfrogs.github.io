    ### How do I Mint?

    1. First **Connect** an Ethereum wallet! Don't have a wallet? We recommend Meta Mask
        Browser extensions will automatically be deteced, and a request will be sent with your provider. When using a mobile device: Use the built in browser within your wallet's app.

    2. Next, **Select** up to NINE Frogs to mint per transaction!

    3. Then, Click on **Mint** (transact) to send to submit the transaction!

    4. Finally, Review and **Confirm** the request with your provider and send the transaction!

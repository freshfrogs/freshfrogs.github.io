### What is Fresh Frogs NFT?

---

<desc id="description">

    Fresh Frogs NFT is a collection of 4,040 randomly generated frogs that are each unique with thousands of different color combinations, traits, accessories, and more!

    Unbelievably, over 200,000 acres of rainforest are burned every day. That is over 150 acres lost every minute of every day, and 78 million acres are lost every year! A portion of every re-sale will be donated to The Rainforest Foundation, where every 1.00 ETH in donations will save 2.5 acres of natural rainforest forever!

### What is "Morphing" and How do I Morph?

---

- Frog holders will be able to "Morph" two Frogs to create a new NFT on Ethereum with combined attributes! Morphing will require a special token aquired through staking!

- Everyone can preview their morphs now at **[freshfrogs.io/the-pad](https://freshfrogs.io/the-pad)**


### What is Staking?

---

- NFT staking refers to locking up non-fungible tokens on a platform or protocol in exchange for staking rewards and other benefits! Staking NFTs allows holders to earn an income from their collection while maintaining ownership!

- Owner's can stake their Frogs to earn special tokens, rewards, participate in raffles, and more!

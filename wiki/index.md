### How do I Mint?

1. First **Connect** an Ethereum wallet! Don't have a wallet? We recommend **[Meta Mask](https://metamask.io/download/)** ü¶ä

    - Go to **[freshfrogs.io](https://freshfrogs.io)** Browser extensions will automatically be detected, a request will be sent to your provider.
    
    - When using a mobile device: Use the built in browser within your wallet app.

2. Next, **Select** up to NINE Frogs to mint per transaction!

    - You may mint up to NINE Frogs per transaction with a max of 40 Frogs per wallet!

3. Then, Click on **Mint** (transact) to submit the transaction!

4. Finally, Review and **Confirm** the transaction!

    - Review and confirm the request with your provider to send the transaction!

    - Make sure all details are correct, and the gas limit is appropriate!

- _What are Gas Fees?_

    - A "Gas Fee" is required when minting any NFT on to the Ethereum blockchain. **[Learn more](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gas-ethereum.asp)**


### How do I View My Frogs?

### What is "Morphing" and How do I Morph?

---

- Frog holders will be able to "Morph" two Frogs to create a new NFT on Ethereum with combined attributes! Morphing will require a special token aquired through staking!

- Everyone can preview their morphs now at **[freshfrogs.io/the-pad](https://freshfrogs.io/the-pad)**


### What is Staking?

---

- NFT staking refers to locking up non-fungible tokens on a platform or protocol in exchange for staking rewards and other benefits! Staking NFTs allows holders to earn an income from their collection while maintaining ownership!

- Owner's can stake their Frogs to earn special tokens, rewards, participate in raffles, and more!

### What is Fresh Frogs NFT?

---

<desc id="description">

    Fresh Frogs NFT is a collection of 4,040 randomly generated frogs that are each unique with thousands of different color combinations, traits, accessories, and more!

    Unbelievably, over 200,000 acres of rainforest are burned every day. That is over 150 acres lost every minute of every day, and 78 million acres are lost every year! A portion of every re-sale will be donated to The Rainforest Foundation, where every 1.00 ETH in donations will save 2.5 acres of natural rainforest forever!

### What is Morphing?

<div class="float-img2">
    <img class="frogImg3" src="../the-pad/SpecialFrog/peace.png"/>
    <img class="frogImg3" src="../the-pad/Trait/peace/peace_gif.gif"/>

</div>

Holders will be soon able to "Morph" two Frogs to create a new NFT on Ethereum with combined traits! Morphing will require a special token aquired through staking!

- What will happen to My Frogs after I Morph?

    - Existing Frogs will remain without change, and a NEW NFT will be created on Ethereum!

- When will the full Morph utility be released?

    - Once the full collection of 4,040 Frogs has been minted!

- What will it cost to Morph?

    - Morphing will require a special token aquired through staking, and a gas fee will be needed to create the NEW NFT! These "special tokens" will be free and easy to obtain for Frog owners through [staking]()!

- What is Meta-Morphing?

    - (N)ew (F)rog (T)okens can be combined to create even more Frogs! More details coming soon!


### How do I Morph?

---

Preview Frog Morph Combinations!

1. **Connect** an Ethereum Wallet that holds Fresh Frog Tokens!

2. Go to the <button id="morph_ref" class="buttonbar_morph"><b>üçÑMorph</b></button> tab and **Select** two Frogs to Morph!

    - First select the **Base Frog!** This Frog will keep all attributes, except for colored traits! 

    - Then select the **Sub Frog!** This frog will have all attributes inherited, without overwriting existing!

    - This means there are two possible morph combinations for every two Frogs!

        - **Example** FROG A + FROG B will have a different outcome than FROG B + FROG A

3. **Generate Morph!**

    - A NEW Frog will be generated with combined attributes!

    - This is currently just a preview until the full utility is released!


### What is Staking?

---

NFT staking refers to locking up non-fungible tokens on a platform or protocol in exchange for staking rewards and other benefits! Staking NFTs allows holders to earn an income from their collection while maintaining ownership!

- Frog Owners will have the option to stake in return for special tokens! That can be used to redeem free mints, morph, enter raffles and more rewards!

- Passive Income from Fresh Frog Staking -- Passive income streams, via royalty payouts and token rewards!

    - Fresh Frog Owners will be able to stake to earn **passive income** by **a.)** earning tokens that can be used for utilities and **b.)** loyalty reward payments from sales royalties!

### What is Fresh Frogs NFT?

---

<desc id="description">

    Fresh Frogs NFT is a collection of 4,040 randomly generated frogs that are each unique with thousands of different color combinations, traits, accessories, and more!

    Unbelievably, over 200,000 acres of rainforest are burned every day. That is over 150 acres lost every minute of every day, and 78 million acres are lost every year! A portion of every re-sale will be donated to The Rainforest Foundation, where every 1.00 ETH in donations will save 2.5 acres of natural rainforest forever!

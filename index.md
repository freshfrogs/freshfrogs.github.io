<title>Fresh Frogs NFT (FROG)</title>
<h1 class="h1">Fresh Frogs NFT</h1><hr>
Fresh Frogs NFT is a collection of 4,040 randomly generated frogs that are each unique with thousands of different color combinations, traits, accessories, and more! Available for mint at https://freshfrogs.github.io/

A portion of every initial sale will be donated to [The Rainforest Foundation](https://rainforestfoundation.org/)

Unbelievably, over 200,000 acres of rainforest are burned every day. That is over 150 acres lost every minute of every day, and 78 million acres are lost every year! For every 1.00 ETH donated, two and a half acres of rainforest will be saved forever!

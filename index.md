## Forest Frogs NFT Collection

> Forest Frogs is a NFT collection of 4,040 randomly generated frogs that are each unique with thousands of different color combinations, traits, accessories, and more! Unbelievably,
> over 200,000 acres of rainforest are burned every day. That is over 150 acres lost every minute of every day, and 78 million acres are lost every year! A portion of every initial
> sale will be donated to [The Rainforest Foundation](https://rainforestfoundation.org/) via a direct transfer to their Ethereum wallet. For every 1.00 ETH donated, two and a half
> acres of rainforest will be saved! As many as 80 different frog species can be found in a single acre of lowland rainforest section alone! So I hope that every FROG owner will be
> reminded of one of the many species they helped save. Available for mint at [NF7UOS.github.io](htttps://NF7UOS.github.io) #NFT #NotForestTermination

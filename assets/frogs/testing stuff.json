‚ÑπÔ∏è How to Mint from Our Collection

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Connect an Ethereum Wallet**
First go to https://freshfrogs.github.io/ and connect your **Ethereum Wallet**.
The Minting Terminal will refresh once your wallet has been linked.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Don't have a wallet? We recommend **[Meta Mask](https://metamask.io/download/)** ü¶ä

üì≤ **Minting on a [Mobile Device](https://freshfrogs.github.io/mobile)**
Make sure that you are using your wallet's browser or your wallet won't link!
- Mobile devices will automatically be redirected to our /mobile terminal

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Using Invites Codes** (Free Whitelist)
Invite codes are automatically detected and you will be notified if there are any associated with your wallet address. Simply click '**Apply**' to enable it.

‚ÑπÔ∏è  **What is High Traffic Priority? HTP**
When minting by default we try and get the lowest possible gas fee;
So by clicking '**Set Priority**' you are waiving this for the average gas fee;

:three: **Complete the Transaction**
Up to FOUR FROGs may be minted per transaction;
To mint the selected FROGs, click on '**__Mint (transact)__**' locate on the Left hand side

Fresh Frogs NFT is a collection of *4,040* randomly generated frogs that are each unique with thousands of different color combinations, traits, accessories, attributes, and more! 

Unbelievably, over 200,000 acres of rainforest are burned every day. That is over 150 acres lost every minute of every day, and 78 million acres are lost every year! A portion of every initial sale will be donated to [The Rainforest Foundation](https://rainforestfoundation.org/) via a direct transfer to their Ethereum wallet.

For every 1.00 ETH donated, 2 1/2 acres of rainforest will be saved forever! More than 80 different frog species can be found in a single acre of lowland rainforest section alone! I hope that every FROG owner will be reminded of one of the many species they helped save.

Available to mint only at https://freshfrogs.github.io

***What is :diving_mask: The FROG POND***? :frog: 
Is an investment pool funded by sales royalties off the **Fresh Frogs NFT (FROG)** collection

`Smart Contract (Ethereum Network)`
**Fresh Frogs NFT** `0xbe4bef8735107db540de269ff82c7de9ef68c51b`

`Official Ethereum ERC-721 Token ID`
**FROG**

:person_raising_hand: **How does it work?**
:one: Every time a **FROG** is sold, a percentage of the sale in Eth will be sent to 'The **FROG POND**'

:two: The __FROG POND is a smart contract__ that will pool the funds and invest them into crypto assets

:three: Gains made from these investments will be available for withdrawal by FROG token holders

:four: Each FROG token holder would be able to withdrawal funds at any time from the smart contract; - the withdrawer would be responsible for paying the gas fee

:person_raising_hand: **What Does it Cost?**
:information_source: You simply have to own a NFT from the Fresh Frogs NFT collection; that is the only requirement
:information_source: The only cost requirement would be the gas fee to withdrawal from **The FROG POND**

:person_tipping_hand: **When Will This be Released?**
:information_source: Once the entire Fresh Frogs NFT collection has been minted;
:information_source: This is not a confirmed feature but will be implemented after final release

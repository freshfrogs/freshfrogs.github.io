# FactoriaMinter
Bare bones Factoria minting page

## Note
The only assumption made is you are using Pure.css. Nothing is tied to this CSS framework so this is easily replaceable.


## Caveat
The mint form loads the invite key that allows the most mints for a connected wallet. If you want to allow multiple invite keys, this is not suitable. May not work with F0 v2.
